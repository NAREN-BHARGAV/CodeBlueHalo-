## 📖 Overview

**CodeBlueHalo.ai** is an advanced, AI-powered campus safety and health-tech infrastructure system designed to protect college students with smart, real-time monitoring and instant alerts. 

By eliminating the need for wearables, we adopt a **"Software-Heavy, Hardware-Light"** architectural approach. Our system continuously monitors environmental factors and behavioral patterns in hostels and laboratories to proactively detect anomalies, alert authorities, and save lives in critical time windows.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Multi-Threat Detection Engine:** Identifies up to **7 distinct emergency classes**, ranging from medical emergencies to potential environmental hazards.
- **⚡ Edge & Cloud Synergy:** 
  - **Edge:** Utilizes lightweight **Temporal Convolutional Network Autoencoders (TCN-AE)** for instantaneous local anomaly detection (Zero-Loophole Escalation).
  - **Cloud:** Employs a robust **Transformer-based Multi-Sensor Fusion Engine** for deep relational analysis on the backend.
- **👁️ Behavioral Drift Analysis:** Flags prolonged unusual passive states (e.g., severe lethargy) as potential mental health or silent physical health deteriorations.
- **🛡️ Privacy-First ML:** Integrated **Federated Learning** ensures models learn from decentralized data points without compromising individual student privacy.
- **📊 Explainable AI Dashboard:** Real-time, transparent visualizations of sensor data, threat levels, and alert histories for administrative oversight.

## 🏆 The Hackathon Journey

**HACK-O-HERTZ '26** was a high-energy, sleepless 36-hour sprint. From pitching the big idea to building hardware prototypes and delivering a 100% hardware+software integrated final demo, the journey was incredibly rewarding.

- **Phase I:** Pitching the core problem statement & solution.
- **Phase II:** Extensive coding, model tuning, and hardware prototyping.
- **Phase III:** Demoing our MVP with live real-world sensor testing.
- **Phase IV:** Final Boss Round—flawless hardware & software integration pitch.

We laughed, we coded through the night, and ultimately brought home a **Motivation Prize of ₹1000**, proudly securing a spot in the **Top 5 out of 100+ amazing teams!**
